On  whether genre and release date infuence movie ratings, I think it goes without saying that using those two variables alone holds little (if any) predictive power for movie ratings. Not only are there more factors involved in movie performance, there is also the matter of 'survivorship bias' among movies with an early release date; a movie that is still being watched (and reviewed) years after its release can be presumed to be 'good,' given that it has stood the test of time. However, I think this data tells an interesting historical story! Based on my own (admittedly limited) movie knowledge, some of the patterns in the  'Mean rating per genre over time' plot appear to reflect movie trends. For example, we can get an idea of when a certain genre was over-saturated with cash grabs (low mean ratings, such as we see for horror in the early 00s), or when the may have been interest in a particular topic (for example, the Star Wars films were released when the mean rating for Sci fi was high -- this isn't due to Star Wars alone, so was there a zeitgeist for sci-fi then?). Also -- the 90s are highly represented, which I presume may  be related to the age of reviewers, but perhaps it may also be because this is when the 'blockbuster' became a greater phenomenon (this is an assumption on my part, I've never taken a film studies course)
